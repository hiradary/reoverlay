# Setup Sass

Sass is an extension of CSS, adding nested rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more. In Gatsby, Sass code can be translated to well-formatted, standard CSS using a plugin.

Install necessary NPM packages

<NPMPackage name="node-sass" />
<NPMPackage name="gatsby-plugin-sass" />

Install the Emotion plugin in gatsby-config.js

<GatsbyPlugin name="gatsby-plugin-sass" />

Sweet, now it's ready to go.

Let's also write out an example stylesheet and page you can use to play
with Sass.

<File
  path="src/styles.scss"
  content="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/marcysutton/19f2efe390e9485968c8fef37795d8ea/raw/2de533ef017bb42b16825670b923a0cd912cc808/styles.scss"
