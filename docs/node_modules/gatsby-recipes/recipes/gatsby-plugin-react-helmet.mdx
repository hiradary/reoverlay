# Add React Helmet

React Helmet is a reusable React component will manage all of your changes to the document head.

Helmet takes plain HTML tags and outputs plain HTML tags. It's dead simple, and React beginner friendly.

[gatsby-plugin-helmet](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-react-helmet/?=react%20helmet) makes it easy to use React Helmet inside Gatsby projects as it automatically adds title and meta tags to the HTML during SSR.
